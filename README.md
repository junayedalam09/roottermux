# roottermux
root - termux

have you ever wanted to run scripts but they need root access or for some reason you want to enter your commands in the real linux environment? in this tutorial, it is executed only by running a Termux script in root mode.

Run these commands in Termux:
#install git 
pkg install git - y

#clone from github with git



git clone https://github.com/junayedalam09/roottermux.git
